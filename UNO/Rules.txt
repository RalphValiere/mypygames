' Player tries to match the displayed card in the Discard Pile.\n',
' Player must match either by the number, color, or the Symbol/Action.\n',

' Player must place either a red card or a card with an 8 on it.\n',
' Players can also play a Wild card (which can alter current color in play).\n',
' ##\n',
' ##\n',
' If Player has no matches or chooses not to play any of their cards even though\n',
' they might have a match, they must draw a card from the Draw pile.\n',
' If that card can be played, Player must play it. Otherwise, Player keeps the\n',
' card and the game moves on to the next player in turn.\n',
' You can also play a Wild card, or a Wild Draw Four card on your turn.\n',
' ##\n',
' ##\n',
' If first card displayed is an Action card, the Action from that card applies and\n',
' must be carried out by the first player.\n',
' The exceptions are if a Wild or Wild Draw Four card is turned up.:\n',
' - If it is a Wild card, first Player to start can choose whatever color to begin play.\n', 
' - If the first card is a Wild Draw Four card – another card will be displayed.\n',

' or play a Wild Four when a Wild Four is displayed.\n',

' Game continues until a player has one card left. The moment a player has just\n', 
' one card, it will be displayed to all others players that this player is “UNO!”.\n',
' Assuming that Player is unable to play their last card and needs to draw, but after drawing\n',
' is then able to play/discard that penultimate card, the same "UNO" message will b displayed\n',

' points are scored, and the game begins over again.\n',
' The first player to achieve 500 points wins the game.\n',

' #\n',
' [Skip] - The next player turn is skipped their turn.
' It can only be played on a card that matches by color, or on another Skip card.\n',
' If displayed at the beginning of play, first player loses turn. The next player starts the game.\n',
' [Draw Two] – Next player gets two more cards and skip their turn.\n',
' #\n',

' If a challenge is called, the hand of the player who played the card will be revealed.\n',
' If guilty, the Player who played the "Wild Draw Four" need to draw 4 cards.\n',
' If not, the challenger needs to draw 6 cards instead.\n',

' This means some players may end up with either more or less cards than what they had before.\n',
' Also, person who played the "Wild Shuffle Hands" gets to choose what color to resume play.\n',
' If displayed at the start of the game, first player only chooses the color that begins play.\n',
' #\n',
' [Wild Customizable Card] – They are all blank at the beginning of the game.\n',
' These are meant to select from other available set of rules.\n',
